        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a rising junior at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) 
            studying Computer Science. My main interests in CS are 
            Algorithms, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data 
            Structures. That being said, there are still
            so many more topics in CS that I have yet to explore and may have
            interest in.
        </p>

        <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
        <p>Included are three projects both academic and personal that I worked on over the
            past few years. Two of the projects are programming intensive, the third is a 
            combination of a few disciplines.

          <h4>Drone Swarm Visualization</h4>
          <p>A Hackathon project that simulates drone swarms and vizualizes their movements. 
              The drones work as clients to the simulation which was the server. Each drone
              is independent and uses its own logic and information from surrounding drone 
              to determine path to travel.

          <h4>r/Place Replication and Bots</h4>
          <p>As a class project I made a client server immitation of reddit's r/Place page
              from a few years ago. If you don't know what r/Place is, it was a webpage were people
              could change one pixel on the page at a time to create anything. The project had all 
              the elements from the original only simplified. As an addition to the project, I 
              created a bot that used Google's custom search api to image search the user's input 
              and scale the image to the size of the board and draw it using the limited colors given.

          <h4>Racing Drone</h4>
          <p>A summer project I embarked on to create a racing drone from scratch (mostly). The project
              entailed designing and 3D printing a drone body, researching all the electronic components,
              and programming the controller. This is one of my favorite projects since it combined so many
              different disciplines, that I was new to, together. The final product was a very fast an low
              profile drone that I ended up crashing. :(
