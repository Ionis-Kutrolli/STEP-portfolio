      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a rising junior at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) 
          studying Computer Science. My main interests in CS are AI, 
          Algorithms and Data Structures. That being said, there are still
          so many more topics in CS that I have yet to explore and may have
          interest in.</p>
