            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a rising junior at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) 
                studying Computer Science. My main interests in CS are AI, 
                Algorithms and Data Structures. That being said, there are still
                so many more topics in CS that I have yet to explore and may have
                interest in.

            <h2>Previous Projects</h2>
            <p>Included are three projects both academic and personal that I worked on over the
                 past few years. Two of the projects are programming intensive, the third is a 
                 combination of a few disciplines.

                <h4>Drone Swarm Visualization</h4>
                <p>A Hackathon project that simulates drone swarms and vizualizes their movements. 
                    The drones work as clients to the simulation which was the server. Each drone
                    is independent and uses its own logic and information from surrounding drone 
                    to determine path to travel.

                <h4>r/Place Replication and Bots</h4>
                <p>As a class project I made a client server immitation of reddit's r/Place page
                    from a few years ago. If you don't know what r/Place is, it was a webpage were people
                    could change one pixel on the page at a time to create anything. The project had all 
                    the elements from the original only simplified. As an addition to the project, I 
                    created a bot that used Google's custom search api to image search the user's input 
                    and scale the image to the size of the board and draw it using the limited colors given.

                <h4>Racing Drone</h4>
                <p>A summer project I embarked on to create a racing drone from scratch (mostly). The project
                    entailed designing and 3D printing a drone body, researching all the electronic components,
                    and programming the controller. This is one of my favorite projects since it combined so many
                    different disciplines, that I was new to, together. The final product was a very fast an low
                    profile drone that I ended up crashing. :(
