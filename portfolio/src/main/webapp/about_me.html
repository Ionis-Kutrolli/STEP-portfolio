        <h2>About Me: Part II</h2>
        <p>I'm Ionis Kutrolli, but if you are on this page you knew that 
            already. This is my less technical about me page. I was born in
            Michigan but only lived there for 4 years. After the 4 years in
            Michigan, I moved to Massachusetts and that is where I have lived
            ever since.

        <h5>Hobbies</h5>
        <p>When I have free time you can find me doing one of three things. 
            The first and probably my favorite hobby is rock climbing, specifically
            bouldering. I started rock climbing in the beginning of 2019 and it has
            pretty much dominated my life ever since. 
            My second hobby is CAD and 3D printing. I have always loved designing and 
            creating new things and this hobby falls right into that. It is so nice to 
            be able to think something up, design it and print it into the real world.
            My last hobby is board games and video games. It always so nice after a long
            day to play a board game or video game with friends.
        </p>
        <h5>Languages</h5>
        <p>My family is from Albania so when I grew up I learned two languages at the
            same time. As a result, now I am fluent in both English and Albanian. I 
            think it is really cool to speak Albanian because not that many people
            speak it in comparison to English.
